# Medical-Image-Analysis-Project-2019
A small project attempting to segment the left ventricle myocardium using standard image processing methods 
Currently work-in-progress (will be properly organized later in few weeks).

Program done with MATLAB r2018a in May 2019, partly recreating the work by M. P. Jolly et. Al. 

Works on Cine-MRI only due to movement based feature extraction
